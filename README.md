# Unscented Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project "unscented Kalman filter" is based on the same structure as the extended Kalman filter.
It uses a main file that calls a function called ProcessMeasurement. Anything important happens in this function. The function is part of the class ukf.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= v3.5
* make >= v4.1
* gcc/g++ >= v5.4

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt`. You can find
   some sample inputs in 'data/'.
    - eg. `./UnscentedKF ../data/sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-1.txt output.txt`

## PROJECT PASSING CRITERIA
There are several criteria that must be fulfilled to pass the project.

- The overall processing chain (prediction, laser update or radar update depending on measurement type) must be correct.
- The student is not allowed to use values from the future to reason about the current state.
- It must be possible to run the project in three different modes: considering laser only, with considering radar only, or with using both sensors.
- For every mode, the overall RMSE (2d position only) may not be more than 10% increased to what the original solution is able to reach (this number depends on the individual measurement sequence)
- The RMSE of laser AND radar must be lower than radar only or laser only
- The NIS of radar measurements must be between 0.35 and 7.81 in at least 80% of all radar update steps.
